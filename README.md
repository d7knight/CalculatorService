# CalculatorService

This is a simple coding challenge in Node js using the Jasmine testing framework and Karma Test Runner.

The calculator service has the following operations:

- enterDigit(digit) - digit is string, e.g. 'one' 
- enterOperation(operation) - operation is one character, e.g. '+' 
- enterEquals() 
- enterClear() - full clear 
- getDisplay() - returns current display as a string

I fully implemented the calculator service and tested it thoroughly using plenty of unit tests afterwards.
